platforms should check for collision: then, if top part has touched the object, then callback the collided object so that object can reset hasJumped=0 so it can carry on jumping.

void onPacketReceived(){
	StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();

	stopWatch.Start();

	long time = 0;
	string s = "jump,30";
    string[] ss = s.Split(',');
    KeyCode key = getKeyCode(ss[0]);
    int.TryParse(ss[1], out int ping);

    stopWatch.Stop();

    time = stopWatch.elapsedMilliseconds + ping;
}

when keydown, packet should be "[ping],jump"
when player lands on platform, packet should be "[ping],platform_x,xpos,ypos,zpos,xrot,yrot,zrot,xvel,yvel,zvel"
